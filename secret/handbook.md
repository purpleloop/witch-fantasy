The artifact was known as the balance of the two magics, hope and despair. After some time, the artifact was stolen and no one could figure out where it was located.

Some weeks later, strange things started to happen in the grey hills. Worrying news arrived from this land to the king castle. A messenger reported that the region was desolated, the living beings where only the shadow of themselves. 

The four witches of the Furnace Circle were summoned by the king at Kilara. They got the trace of the artifact in a distant tower. They faced a dark wizard whose darkness was transcended by the mysterious artifact.

The artifact suddenly shattered into several parts ant the despair magic spread around all the tower. Witches were directly exposed to the source of despair magic.

The witches did not succomb, relying on their hope magic but they were severely affected. As the dark wizard was nowhere to be found, the witches return back to Kilara with the remaining parts of the artifact.The witches entered Kilara's castle where the parts of the artifact where sealed by a set of runes in a chest in the dungeon.

The witches retired separately in the woods to slowly recover by the blessings of nature.
