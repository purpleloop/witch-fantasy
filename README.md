# witch-fantasy
A 2D game essay in Java

Witch Fantasy tells the story of a young witch red-haired as fire.

The game goes through seasons
- spring : flourishing, clear
- summer : sunny, shiny
- fall : red, orange, brown Halloween background
- winter : snow, fog

Level are 2D environments, with natural boundaries and obstacles.
Some houses are present, and villagers come and go in the area to harvest fields in the surrounding and bring back food to their home.

Fountains can lead to another location of the map, or to other worlds.

Chests contain magic artifacts that enable the witch to change her appearance :
- Apprentice
- Normal
- A huge spider
- A black crow (maybe I dunno, to come ?)
